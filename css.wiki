§ CSS

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**CSS**, short for **cascading style sheets**, is a technology of the [[world-wide-web]].

**CSS** is a [[human-legible]] [[source-code]] for //styling//.
It is used when doing [[web-development]] to //style// a [[web-page]] written in [[html]], [[xml]], or [[xul]].

**CSS** looks like this:

	body {
		background-color: #e7dec7;
		color: #5d4c32;
	}
	
	main {
		text-align: justify;
	}
	
	.screaming {
		font-weight: bold;
		text-transform: uppercase;
	}

Somewhat comparable technologies to **CSS** include:

• [[xsl]]
• [[xslt]]

I recall hearing a story, decades ago, that **CSS** was based on styling technology from the [[wordperfect]] [[word-processor]] software.
