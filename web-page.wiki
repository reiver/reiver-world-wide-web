§ web-page

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

A **web-page** is a resource on the [[world-wide-web]], primarily meant to be viewed by humans using a [[web-browser]].

**Web-Pages** are almost always (at some level) written in the [[html]], and usually provide [[hyper-link]]s to other **web-pages** and other resources (that are usually but not always on the [[world-wide-web]]).
(As an example of a **web-page** //not// written in HTML — some **web-pages** been written in [[xml]] and [[xul]].)

§§ Spellings

//web-page// is also sometimes written as //webpage// and //web page//.

§§ Example

The [[source-code]] of a [[web-page]] is (at some level) written in [[html]].

There are different varieties of [[html]], but — here is an example of a very very simple **web-page** written in [[html]]  —

	<html>
		<head>
			<meta charset="utf-8" />
			<title>Hello world!</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<h1>Hi!</h1>
			<p>
				How do you do?
			</p>
		</body>
	</html>

This is [[source-code]] and typically not meant to be directly read.
Typically a [[web-browser]] would be used to //render// this [[html]] [[source-code]] into a document which is meant for a human to read.
