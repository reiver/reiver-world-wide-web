§ XUL

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**XUL**, which is short for **XML User Interface Language**, is an [[xml]]-based [[markup-language]] for creating [[graphical-user-interface]]s (**GUI**s).
**XUL** was developed by people doing work for  Mozilla.

§§ XUL XML Namespace

The [[xml-namespace]] for **XUL** is:

	http:/((/))www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul

§§ Ghostbusters Easter-Egg

If you look at that page, you are greeted with the message:

― There is no data. 
― There is only XUL!

This is an //homage// to a line in the (original) **Ghostbusters** movie from the year 1984 —

― There is no Dana. 
― There is only Zuul!

§§ XUL Example

This is a very, very simple **XUL** file —

	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	
	<!DOCTYPE window>
	
	<window id="helloworld" width="640" height="480" xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul">
		<description value="Hello world!" />
	</window>

§§ History of XUL

Although many conjectured and talked about the creation of a markup language for GUIs — **XUL** along with [[gladexml]], were the first 2 GUI [[markup-languange]]s (that I am aware of anyway).
These 2 similar technologies seemed to be created independently of each other and largely without knowledge of the other.

§§ XUL versus XAML

XUL had been around for a long time before [[xaml]] showed up.

[[XAML]] is essentially a copy of **XUL**.
